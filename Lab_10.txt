# Parameters
R = 1.387 # Cell Radius in km
n = 4 # Number of cells
N = 60 # Total number of channels
area = round(2.5981 * R**2) # Area covered per cell (rounded)
C = N / 4 # Number of channels per cell
A = 9 # Traffic intensity from Erlang C chart with GOS = 0.05 and Au = 0.029
# Question (a)
Au = 0.029 # Traffic per user
U = math.floor(A / Au) # Total number of users
U_per = round(U / area) # Number of users per square km
print(f"(a) Number of users per square km: {U_per} users/sq km\n")
# Question (b)
lambda_ = 1 # Arrival rate in hours
H = (Au / lambda_) * 3600 # Holding time in seconds
t = 10 # Time delay in seconds (assumed to be 10s as per the MATLAB code)
Prb = math.exp((-(C - A) * t) / H) # Probability of delay
print(f"(b) The probability that a delayed call will have to wait: {Prb * 100:.2f}%\n")
# Question (c)
Prc = 0.05 * Prb * 100 # 5% probability of a delayed call
print(f"(c) The probability that a call will be delayed: {Prc:.2f}%\n")
